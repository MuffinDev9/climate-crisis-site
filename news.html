                It's a nutritional food source, an alternative to plastic,
                has medicinal properties and can help to limit global heating:
                Marine algae might just be the next weapon in the fight against climate change.

        <p class="news">From February 9 to 11, the French town of Brest is hosting the One Ocean Summit,
            the first international summit dedicated to protecting the world's oceans. NGOs,
            scientists, business leaders and heads of state will meet in the Breton town to discuss how to protect
            marine ecosystems and promote sustainability. </p>

        <p class="news">Philippe Potin, a marine biologist and researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, 
            and Vincent Doumeizel, a senior advisor and food expert for the United Nations Global Compact, 
            speak to FRANCE 24 about what's at stake at the summit. </p>

        <p class="news">There's one point on which they are unanimous. “We have to invest in marine algae!” they say.</p>

        <p class="news">“Often, when we talk about algae, it conjures up this negative image of piles of green or brown slime washed up on beaches in Brittany or the Caribbean. 
            It's a real shame,” says Potin. “When seaweed ends up on beaches, it's because it's been dragged up from the seabed by pollution or industrial activity. 
            It's not the problem, it's a consequence.” </p>

        <p class="news">"The reality is that these plants play a vital role for our planet,” Potin continues. Seaweed is to marine environments what forests are to the land. 
            “They're also the lungs of the planet. Thanks to their photosynthesizing, they absorb CO2 and emit oxygen,” he explains. 
            “Alone, they are responsible for half of all of Earth's renewal of oxygen. They are hugely helpful for the climate.”</p>
