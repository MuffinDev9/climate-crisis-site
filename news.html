                It's a nutritional food source, an alternative to plastic,
                has medicinal properties and can help to limit global heating:
                Marine algae might just be the next weapon in the fight against climate change.
            </strong>

        <p class="news">From February 9 to 11, the French town of Brest is hosting the One Ocean Summit,
            the first international summit dedicated to protecting the world's oceans. NGOs,
            scientists, business leaders and heads of state will meet in the Breton town to discuss how to protect
            marine ecosystems and promote sustainability. </p>

        <p class="news">Philippe Potin, a marine biologist and researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, 
            and Vincent Doumeizel, a senior advisor and food expert for the United Nations Global Compact, 
            speak to FRANCE 24 about what's at stake at the summit. </p>

        <p class="news">There's one point on which they are unanimous. “We have to invest in marine algae!” they say.</p>

        <p class="news">“Often, when we talk about algae, it conjures up this negative image of piles of green or brown slime washed up on beaches in Brittany or the Caribbean. 
            It's a real shame,” says Potin. “When seaweed ends up on beaches, it's because it's been dragged up from the seabed by pollution or industrial activity. 
            It's not the problem, it's a consequence.” </p>

        <p class="news">"The reality is that these plants play a vital role for our planet,” Potin continues. Seaweed is to marine environments what forests are to the land. 
            “They're also the lungs of the planet. Thanks to their photosynthesizing, they absorb CO2 and emit oxygen,” he explains. 
            “Alone, they are responsible for half of all of Earth's renewal of oxygen. They are hugely helpful for the climate.”</p>
        
        <p class="news">"They are also indispensable to ocean life because they help to create habitats for thousands of different types of fish and shellfish. 
            There's then a knock-on effect, because it's in part thanks to algae that we have such a variety of fishing stock on the coasts.” </p>

        <p class="news">In total, some 10,000 species of algae visible to the naked eye grow across the planet - from sea lettuce in Brittany to Tasmanian kelp and wakame in Japan.  </p>

        <p><strong>'The world's most under-used resource'</strong></p>

        <p class="news">On top of the role seaweed plays for the climate and biodiversity, it can also be useful across a number of other sectors, like food, industry and even medicine. </p>

        <p class="news">“It's one of the world's most under-used resources,” says Doumeizel. 
            “Our planet is made up of 70 percent water and yet the seas and oceans only account for three percent of our food supply. It's absurd.”</p>
        
        <p class="news">He goes on, “We know that one of the biggest challenges we face this century is that we have reached our limit on land in terms of the food industry. 
            We're running out of land and intensive agriculture is particularly damaging for the planet … It's clearly time to think of new ways of doing things.”  </p>
        
        <p class="news">So could seaweed be the magic answer to these problems? It's already a daily foodstuff in Asia and is recommended by dieticians, 
            who say it's packed full of fibre, protein and vitamins and is low in fat. According to a study carried out by Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands, 
            devoting just two percent of the world's oceans to farming algae could produce enough protein to fulfil the needs of everyone on the planet.</p>
        
        <p class="news">It's not just humans who stand to benefit. “We can also use it to feed animals, particularly cattle. 
            It would help to improve their immune system,” says Doumeizel. In the agricultural sector, 
            a number of French villages - mostly in Brittany - already use seaweed as fertiliser.  </p>
        
        <p class="news">Seaweed is already starting to leave its mark in the medical sector, 
            predominantly in antifungal creams or anti-inflammatory products. Fucales, a type of brown algae, 
            are known for being able to ease heartburn. Recently, researchers registered a patent for a cream and a gel to treat acne made from a type of microalgae.  </p>
        
        <p class="news">In the industrial sector, Europe already counts several companies using seaweed to manufacture biodegradable packaging as an alternative to plastic. 
            "Other companies are planning on using it to make clothing. In the Netherlands, a start-up is even looking into producing sanitary products made from seaweed,” 
            says Doumeizel. </p>
        
        <p class="news">One place where it's actually hard to use algae is in the energy sector. Potin tells FRANCE 24, 
            “For a while we thought about using seaweed to make a biofuel, but the sheer quantity needed to do it is just too much.”</p>
