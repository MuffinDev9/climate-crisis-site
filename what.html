    <p>Climate Change Is An Ongoing Problem, Where Due To Things Like Global Warming, And Pollution, 
        The Weather And Other Parts Of The Climate Are Changing For The Worst.</p>
    <p>Here Is A Snippet About It From The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change" class="blue">United Nations</a>: </p>

        <p class="what">Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. 
            But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
            Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures.
            Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, 
            for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.</p>

        <p>There Are A Lot Of Different Things That Come From Climate Change, Here Are A Few: </p>
        <ul class="climate-list">
            <li>The Polar Ice Caps Melting, And Increasing Flooding In Coastal Areas.</li>
            <li>Weather Getting More Extreme, Such As More Storms, Rain, And Droughts.</li>
            <li>These Weather Changes Make It So That Places Where Animals Can Live Shift, And Crops Get Harder To Grow.</li>
            <li>It Can Also Cause Health ProblemsIn Urban Areas, When People Inhale Smog, Such As Asthma, Heart Disease, And Lung Cancer</li>
